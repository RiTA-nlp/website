## Abstract

Recent large-scale Spoken Language Understanding datasets
focus predominantly on English and do not account for
language-specific phenomena such as particular phonemes or
words in different lects. We introduce ITALIC, the first large-
scale speech dataset designed for intent classification in Ital-
ian. The dataset comprises 16,521 crowdsourced audio samples
recorded by 70 speakers from various Italian regions and an-
notated with intent labels and additional metadata. We explore
the versatility of ITALIC by evaluating current state-of-the-art
speech and text models. Results on intent classification sug-
gest that increasing scale and running language adaptation yield
better speech models, monolingual text models outscore multi-
lingual ones, and that speech recognition on ITALIC is more
challenging than on existing Italian benchmarks. We release
both the dataset and the annotation scheme to streamline the
development of new Italian SLU models and language-specific
datasets.
